Project 3/3: CSS Grid - Advanced CSS Course

This is the third tutorial from Jonas Schmedtmann's course on Advanced CSS hosted on Udemy.

The app is a front-end of a luxury international property sales and realtor (American estate agent) directory.

The technology, in contrast to the first and second projects, which majored heavily on CSS and SCSS/SASS and flexbox respectively, showcases CSS grid methods.

The code shows how little CSS is needed in comparison to older float, and even flexbox.  The code also shows how utilising a little Flexbox makes CSS very versatile.
